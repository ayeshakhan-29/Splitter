# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Setup
### Initialize a demo project locally

1. Initialize a vite-pages project (with npm 7+):
   **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-name>
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    `npm install`
3. `npm run dev` and start the development server and run the application locally.  This command starts the Vite development server, which will watch your files and automatically reload the browser when changes are made. You can view the application by navigating to http://localhost:5173 in your browser.
4. `npm run build` and this command creates an optimized production build of your application in the dist directory.
5. `npm run ssr`. You can [disable javascript in your browser](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/javascript/disable/), to verify if it can still render.

### Read the documentation
