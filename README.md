# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-name>

2. **Install dependencies:**

    npm install

3. **Usage**

    *Development*
    To start the development server and run the application locally:
     ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
     ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This command starts the Vite development server, which will watch your files and automatically reload the browser when changes are made. You can view the application by navigating to http://localhost:5173 in your browser.

    *Production*
    To build the production-ready bundle:
    
    npm run build

    This command creates an optimized production build of your application in the dist directory.
